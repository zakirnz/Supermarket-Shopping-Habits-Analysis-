# Supermarket-Shopping-Habits-Analysis-
This project involved an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of UK supermarket shopping habits, using a simulated dataset of 500 households. The goal was to uncover patterns in consumer spending behaviour, household income and store preferences using descriptive statistics, data visualisations and statistical testing in R.
